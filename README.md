# Our Mission

Empowering Low-Income Communities with Access to Nutritious Food

## Description
The United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal #2 is zero hunger which aims to create a world free of hunger by the year 2030. According to the UN SDG’s, in 2020, between 720 million and 811 million people worldwide were suffering from hunger worldwide. Nearly 2.4 billion people (>30% of the world’s population) described moderate to severe food insecurity and lacked regular access to adequate, nutritious food.

Our group is working toward tackling the UN SDG’s goal target 2.1, “By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.” We first asked ourselves, “How might we increase access to healthy and affordable produce in low-income, urban communities?”, focusing on our own local communities within King County in Washington State.

## Analysis what causes the problem.
Several factors can contribute to urban residents' difficulty accessing healthy and affordable produce. One major factor is the lack of access to grocery stores or farmers' markets in certain neighborhoods, known as "food deserts." These areas are often found in low-income communities. Low income, underserved urban communities tend to make food choices based on the food outlets that are available in their immediate neighborhood. People need access to fresh fruits and vegetables and are instead served by convenience stores or fast food restaurants. Another factor contributing to difficulty accessing local and affordable produce is that fresh fruits and vegetables can be more expensive in urban areas due to higher transportation costs or other expenses. This can make it difficult for low-income residents to afford fresh produce. The third reason might be that urban families often have busy schedules, making it challenging to find the time to shop for fresh produce at farmers' markets or specialty stores. These combined factors make it difficult for urban residents to access local, affordable produce, which can negatively impact their health and well-being.

# Problem Statement

How might we[King County residents] increase access to healthy and affordable produce in low-income, urban communities?

We chose to narrow down our focus on increasing access to healthy and affordable produce in low-income, urban communities within King County, Washington State because we believe that addressing food insecurity and food deserts in our local area is crucial in achieving the UN SDG #2 of ending hunger. These issues disproportionately impact marginalized groups and we want to take action to address them in our own community. By focusing on a specific area, we can better understand the unique challenges and opportunities within our community and develop targeted solutions that can have a real impact on improving access to nutritious food for those in need.

# Our plan to address through the project

The cause that we are going to address through our design is a lack of access to fresh produce and local farms while reducing food wastes. Instead of focusing on the vendors, we decide to shift our attention to low-income, urban communities as well as reduction of food wastes effectively. We made this shift because during our research through food consumption, we found that one-third of the food produced for human consumption goes to waste globally, and nearly half of the fruits and vegetables grown does not get consumed. As Edward S. Spang mentioned in his study, food loss and waste caused significant environmental, economic, and social costs. After doing our research, we found out the pain point behind lacking access to fresh and affordable produce, and decided to address this cause.
