# Testing Protocol
Instructions detailing how to test application via frontend (user accentapnce tests) and backend (unit tests).

## Accentance Tests (Frontend)
Our group generalized a hypothetical user flow that "guides" users through all of NourishKing's key features.

**General User Flow**
1. Users can navigate through pages using the navigation bar.
2. Users can watch the videos in resources.
3. Users can view products.
4. Users can search for products. 
5. Users can sort by price. 
6. Users can add products into the cart.
7. Users can view the added items in the cart.
8. Users can checkout.
9. Users can select the date and location to pick up. 

**Key Features**
1. **Search** 
    &nbsp **a.  Users can search for products**
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Successful Test:_** The search functionality will be tested to ensure that users can search for products on the website. This test will be considered successful if users are able to search for products using keywords and find relevant results.
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Failed Test:_** A failed test would occur if users are unable to search for products or if the search results are not relevant.

2. **Nav Bar**
    &nbsp **a. Users can navigate through pages using the navigation bar.**
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Successful Test:_** The navigation bar will be tested to ensure that users can easily access all pages of the website. This test will be considered successful if the users can navigate to all pages using the navigation bar without encountering any errors or issues.
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Failed Test:_** A failed test would occur if the navigation bar is not functional or if users are unable to access certain pages.

3. **Sort**
    &nbsp **a. Users can sort by price**
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Successful Test:_** he sorting functionality will be tested to ensure that users can sort products by price. This test will be considered successful if users are able to sort products by price in ascending or descending order without encountering any errors or issues.
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Failed Test:_** A failed test would occur if users are unable to sort products by price, or if the sorting results are not displayed correctly.

4. **Cart**
    &nbsp **a. Users can add products into the cart.**
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Successful Test:_** The add button will be tested to ensure that users can add products into their cart. This test will be considered successful if users can click the add button for a particular product and the cart icon will reflect the added amount.
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Failed Test:_** A failed test would occur if users can’t click the add button and see that reflected amount in their cart.

    &nbsp **b. Users can view the added items in the cart.**
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Successful Test:_** The cart button and checkout page will be tested to ensure users can see what items they added to their cart and how many. This test will be considered successful if users can see the amount of products in the cart icon and they can see which products they want to buy in the checkout page.
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Failed Test:_** A failed test would occur if users can see their checkout amount in the cart icon and/or can’t view what products they want to purchase in the checkout page.

5. **Checkout**
    &nbsp **a. Users can select the date and location to pick up.**
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Successful Test:_** The “Pick Up Location & Time” section is tested to ensure users can choose their pick up date and location. This test will be considered successful if users can click the date and location and that action is reflected by that button being highlighted in green. 
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Failed Test:_** A failed test would occur if the user can’t click the time and location they prefer and/or that change isn’t reflected back to the user.

    &nbsp **b. Users can checkout.**
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Successful Test:_** The submit button is tested to ensure users can finish the checkout process. This test will be considered successful if users can click the submit button and be brought to the confirmation page with their respective details displayed.
    &nbsp    &nbsp **_Failed Test:_** A failed test would occur if either the user can’t press the submit button, the confirmation page isn’t shown afterwards, and/or the confirmation page doesn’t reflect the right information.
